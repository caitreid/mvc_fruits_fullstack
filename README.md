# Fruitcakes CRUD Full stack app

- Use Express.js to build a server
- Use Mongoose to communicate with MongoDB
- Full CRUD functionality on our fruits resource
- User Authentication 
- The ability to add comments to fruits
- Maybe: gather data from 3rd party API, if we have time


This app will start as an API, that receives requests and sends JSON responses, but eventually we will add a views layer that will render html in our browser.


## MVC Application
- Models
- Views
- Controllers

Models - all of our data, what shape it's in and what resources we're using (models) and how our resources relate to  one another

Views - all the different ways we can see our data, whether its as a JSON response, or an actual HTML response, this determins how our data can be viewed by the user.

Controllers - connects our views and our models. 
routes are controllers - the ydetermin how a user can interact with our resources
