# Fruitcakes CRUD Full stack app

- Use Express.js to build a server
- Use Mongoose to communicate with MongoDB
- Full CRUD functionality on our fruits resource
- User Authentication 
- The ability to add comments to fruits
- Maybe: gather data from 3rd party API, if we have time


This app will start as an API, that receives requests and sends JSON responses, but eventually we will add a views layer that will render html in our browser.
